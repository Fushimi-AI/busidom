## Risk Mitigation

**Challenge:** Maintaining consistency while building product

**Solution:**
- Batch record 2-3 videos when possible
- Some videos ARE the product journey (easy content)
- Adjust schedule if needed (every 10 days vs weekly)
- Quality > Quantity

**Challenge:** Growing slowly

**Solution:**
- Focus on quality content
- Engage deeply with small audience
- Even 100 engaged subscribers = valuable for product launch
- Consistency matters more than virality

1. ✅ Channel is established before product launch
2. ✅ Have an engaged audience (even if small)

5. ✅ Distribution channel exists for product launch

**Remember:** Building distribution while building product reduces launch risk. Even 500 engaged people is HUGE for a launch.
