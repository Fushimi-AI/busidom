# NOW — Current Focus

**Stop reading. Start building.**

## What We're Building

**An AI-first business operating system** that:
- Replaces 10+ tools (Notion, Jira, Slack, etc.)
- Has an AI co-founder built in (not bolted on)
- Is honest and challenges weak ideas
- Aligns with founder skills and chosen strategy

---

## Current Version: v0.1 → v0.4 (MVP)

We're building the minimum viable product to test the core hypothesis.

---

## The Hypothesis

**"Entrepreneurs using a unified AI-first platform outperform those juggling fragmented tools with bolted-on AI."**

Everything else is noise until we prove this.

## What We're Building (v0.1-v0.4)

| Version | Focus | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **v0.1** | Basic CLI chat | 🔄 In Progress |
| **v0.2** | Memory (JSON persistence) | ⏳ Next |
| **v0.3** | Mentor personality | ⏳ Queued |
| **v0.4** | Context intelligence | ⏳ Queued |

### v0.1 — Foundation

- `/clear` command

### v0.3 — Personality + First Principles

## Success Metric

**Did someone use it twice?**

That's the bar. One person voluntarily returns = hypothesis validated.
