# Business-OS

**Your AI co-founder. From idea to exit.**

> One AI-first platform. Replaces Notion, Jira, Confluence, Slack, mindmaps, and a dozen other tools. Your entire business runs here.

| What | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Problem** | SMEs juggle 10+ tools. 90% of startups fail from avoidable mistakes. Guidance is gatekept. |
| **Solution** | Single AI-first platform with co-founder intelligence, not AI bolted onto old tools |
| **Differentiator** | Not another tool. Not a ChatGPT wrapper. One platform that thinks, remembers, and executes. |
| **Model** | Open source CLI (BYOK) + Subscription GUI ($25-$999/mo, 90% to AI credits) |
| **Vision** | Democratize YC-quality guidance for 100M entrepreneurs via unified AI-first OS |

---

## The Problem

### Tool Fragmentation

SMEs and entrepreneurs are drowning in tools:

| Category | Tools They Use | Problem |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Notes & Docs | Notion, Confluence, Google Docs | Scattered knowledge |
| Project Mgmt | Jira, Asana, Monday, Trello | Context switching |
| Communication | Slack, Teams, Email | Noise, no memory |
| Planning | Miro, Figma, mindmaps | Ideas don't connect to action |
| Analytics | Spreadsheets, dashboards | Manual, no insights |

**Result:** 10+ tools. $500+/month. Zero intelligence connecting them.

### Guidance Gap

90% of startups fail. Not because of bad ideas—but because founders make avoidable mistakes:

- **No guidance** — Working alone without experienced mentorship
- **Wrong priorities** — Building features instead of building a business
- **Knowledge gaps** — Not knowing what you don't know
- **No accountability** — Easy to drift, easy to quit

The solution exists: great co-founders, mentors, accelerators like YC. But access is gatekept by geography, network, and capital.

**Where you're born and who you know still determines if your business succeeds. That's broken.**

---

## The Vision

**What if every entrepreneur had ONE platform that does everything?**

Not 10 tools. Not AI bolted onto legacy software. One AI-first operating system for your entire business.

Business-OS is the great equalizer—a single platform where SMEs and entrepreneurs ideate, plan, execute, communicate, analyze, and grow. With an AI co-founder that knows everything about your business because it IS your business platform.

---

## What This Is

**An AI-first business operating system** that consolidates everything:

| Old Way (10+ Tools) | Business-OS (One Platform) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Notion for docs | **AI Memory** — Docs that understand context |
| Jira for tasks | **AI Tasks** — Auto-prioritized by stage & strategy |
| Slack for comms | **AI Chat** — Conversations that build knowledge |
| Miro for planning | **AI Canvas** — Ideas connected to execution |
| Spreadsheets for data | **AI Analytics** — Insights, not just numbers |
| ChatGPT for advice | **AI Co-Founder** — Persistent, opinionated, contextual |

**Core Hypothesis:** Entrepreneurs using a unified AI-first platform outperform those juggling fragmented tools with bolted-on AI.

---

## What Makes This Different

| Fragmented Tools + AI | Business-OS |
|----------------------|-------------|
| AI bolted onto old software | **AI-first** — built for intelligence from day one |
| Data scattered across tools | **Unified** — one platform, one context, one source of truth |
| Generic AI, no memory | **Contextual** — knows your business, stage, history |
| Tools don't talk to each other | **Connected** — everything linked, nothing siloed |
| You manage the tools | **AI manages** — agents handle the busywork |
| Pay for 10 subscriptions | **One platform** — replaces the stack |

| Generic AI | Business-OS |
|------------|-------------|
| Neutral, agrees with you | **Opinionated** — challenges weak thinking |
| Forgets everything | **Persistent Memory** — vector + structured DB |
| Gives advice | **Action-oriented** — helps execute, not just suggest |
| One-size-fits-all | **Stage-aware** — different guidance for ideation vs. scaling |
| Single AI assistant | **Agent Team** — specialized agents (8.5+ confidence) |

**This is not another tool. It's the only tool you need.**

---

## The Autonomy Progression

Business-OS evolves with you:

1. **Early Stage** — Hands-on guidance. Reviews every decision. Teaches frameworks. Asks you to understand before moving forward.
2. **Growing Stage** — Balanced partnership. Handles routine tasks. Intervenes on important decisions. You lead, it supports.
3. **Mature Stage** — Autonomous partner. Executes independently. Surfaces only what matters. You're in control, it's your co-pilot.

The goal is not dependence. The goal is to make you a better entrepreneur.

## Coding Agent Strategy

**Default:** Kimi Code (Parallel Agents)  
**Alternative:** Claude Code

Business-OS uses AI coding agents for development tasks. Kimi Code is the default due to:

| Factor | Kimi Code | Claude Code |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Cost** | ~10x cheaper | Premium |
| **Parallel Agents** | Up to 100 agents | Sequential |
| **Speed** | 4.5x faster (complex tasks) | Faster tokens |
| **Integration** | Node.js SDK | CLI wrapper |

```bash
# Default (Kimi Code with parallel agents)
bos refactor src/

# Alternative (Claude Code)
bos refactor src/ --agent=claude
```

See [coding-agents.md](./ideation/tech-stack/coding-agents.md) for full strategy.

---

## Who This Is For

Entrepreneurs without access to experienced co-founders or mentors:

- Solopreneurs building their first (or fifth) business
- Technical founders who can build but need business guidance
- Non-technical founders who need help navigating the journey
- Anyone tired of generic AI advice that doesn't fit their situation

---

## Privacy & Security

Your business data is sensitive. We treat it that way.

- **Your data is yours** — Export everything anytime
- **Local-first option** — Data can stay on your device
- **Encrypted** — In transit and at rest
- **No training** — We don't train on your data without consent
- **Compliance path** — SOC 2, GDPR roadmap

---

## Token Optimization

We're obsessed with efficiency. Your credits go further.

- **Hierarchical Memory** — 52% token reduction through smart consolidation
- **Semantic Compression** — Compress context without losing meaning
- **Query Classification** — Simple questions use cheaper models
- **Progressive Loading** — Load only what's needed, when needed
- **MD File Progressive Disclosure** — 4-level disclosure for .bos.md files

### .md Progressive Disclosure Levels

| Level | Content | Tokens |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Index only (filename + description) | ~10/file |
| 1 | Headers + summary | ~50-100/file |
| 2 | Key sections expanded | ~200-500/file |
| 3 | Full content | All tokens |

**70%+ of queries answered without full file load.**

**Target:** 30-50% cost savings without quality loss.

---

## Data Architecture

**Dual-Database System:** Vector + Structured working together.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Structured DB** | PostgreSQL | Users, businesses, tasks, stages, relationships |
| **Vector DB** | pgvector | Semantic search, memory retrieval, context matching |
| **File Context** | .bos.md files | User-editable business context |
| **Cache** | Redis (optional) | Session state, hot data |

### Why Both?

```
User asks: "What did we decide about pricing last month?"

Structured DB: Find conversations from last month
Vector DB: Semantic search for "pricing decisions"
Combined: Precise + Relevant results
```

**Vector DB Powers:**
- Semantic memory retrieval
- Similar context finding
- Relevance scoring for progressive disclosure
- Agent knowledge matching

**Structured DB Powers:**
- User accounts, permissions
- Business stages, relationships
- Task tracking, milestones
- Analytics, metrics history

---

## Agents Management

Your AI team, managed like real employees.

- **Confidence Scoring** — Every output rated 1-10
- **Iteration Until 8.5+** — Agent keeps improving until satisfied
- **Agent Dashboard** — See all agents, their status, performance
- **Meta-Agents** — Agents that create other agents
- **Custom Agents** — Build agents for your specific needs

### Agent Teams by Stage

| Stage | Your Agent Team |
|-------|-----------------|
| 🌱 **Idea** | Mentor, Research, Validation |
| 🚀 **MVP** | + Product, Customer, Dev Advisor |
| 📈 **Growth** | + Marketing, Sales, Analytics, Finance |
| 🏢 **Scale** | + Operations, HR, Legal |

### Agent Teams by Strategy

| Strategy | Specialized Agents |
|----------|-------------------|
| B2B SaaS | Sales Dev, Customer Success, Pricing |
| E-Commerce | Inventory, Merchandising, Ads |
| Content | Content, Engagement, Monetization |
| Service | Booking, Proposal, Delivery |
| Marketplace | Supply, Demand, Trust & Safety |

**"Agentic Employees"** — Think of agents as team members, not just code.

### Agent Personalities

Every agent has a distinct voice:

| Agent | Personality | Style |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| 🧠 **Mentor** | Wise, challenging | "Before we add, what can we delete?" |
| 🔍 **Research** | Precise, data-driven | "Market is $47B, 12% CAGR. Source: Gartner" |
| 💰 **Sales** | Confident, persuasive | "Love that objection—let's talk ROI" |
| 📊 **Analytics** | Calm, pattern-seeking | "Signups up 23%, but activation down 8%" |
| 📣 **Marketing** | Creative, enthusiastic | "I've got three angles for this!" |
| 💵 **Finance** | Conservative, risk-aware | "Post-hire runway: 9 months. Risky." |
| 👥 **Customer** | Empathetic, patient | "I understand. Here's what works..." |

**Feel like a team, not a tool.**

### Alignment & Honesty

**Our job: Help launch QUALITY businesses, not just any business.**

| Commitment | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Truth over comfort** | Tell what you NEED to hear, not want |
| **Challenge bad ideas** | "I need to push back here..." |
| **No false hope** | "I see potential, BUT 3 concerns first" |
| **Admit uncertainty** | "60% chance. Here's what could go wrong" |
| **Recommend stopping** | "This isn't working. Let's pivot or stop" |

**Quality Gates:** Must validate problem, target user, market, and willingness to pay before progressing.

### Founder & Strategy Alignment

| Check | What We Assess |
|-------|----------------|
| **Founder Fit** | Skills, resources, motivations, constraints |
| **Strategy Fit** | Does idea match chosen strategy? |
| **Drift Detection** | Weekly check: actions matching strategy? |
| **Skill Gaps** | What's missing? Co-founder, hire, or learn? |

**Founder + Strategy Matrix:**

|  | Strategy Fit ✅ | Strategy Fit ❌ |
|--|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Founder Fit ✅** | EXECUTE | PIVOT strategy |
| **Founder Fit ❌** | ADAPT (get help) | STOP (wrong business) |

**North Star:** Businesses still alive at 1 year. Not engagement metrics.

### Agent Protocols

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Honesty First** | Truth over comfort. Always. |
| **Confidence First** | No output without 8.5+ confidence |
| **Isolation** | Each agent has its own context |
| **Transparency** | User sees all agent actions |
| **Reversibility** | Any action can be undone |
| **Human Override** | User can always stop |

### Decision Protocol

| Risk | Action |
|------|--------|
| Low (research, format) | Auto-execute |
| Medium (email, schedule) | Propose → Approve |
| High (financial, delete) | User decides |

### Skills

Reusable workflows combining agents:

```yaml
skill: weekly-planning
trigger: "monday 9am" or "/weekly"
steps:
  1. Review last week (Mentor)
  2. Analyze metrics (Analytics)
  3. Identify priorities (Mentor)
  4. Create plan (Mentor)
  5. User confirms
output: weekly_plan.md
```

### Invocation Patterns

| Pattern | Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Direct | User command | `/research competitors` |
| Contextual | Agent needs help | Mentor asks Research |
| Scheduled | Cron | Every Monday 9am |
| Event | Condition met | Stage changed |
| Chain | Sequential | Skill steps |

## Pricing

### The ROI Perspective

Before you look at prices, consider what you're replacing:

| Resource | Monthly Cost | Business-OS Replaces |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Part-time consultant | $2,000-5,000 | ✅ Strategic guidance |
| Notion + Jira + Slack | $50-200 | ✅ All-in-one platform |
| Market research tools | $200-500 | ✅ Research agent |
| Business coach | $500-2,000 | ✅ 24/7 mentorship |
| **Total** | **$2,750-7,700** | **All included** |

**One resource mindset:** If you'd pay $5,000/mo for a part-time co-founder who's available 24/7, never forgets context, and challenges your thinking—Business-OS is a fraction of that.

### Open Source CLI — Free
- BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

## Philosophy

> "If you're not embarrassed by your first version, you launched too late."

This is the embarrassing first version. Ship, learn, iterate.
