## Launch Content

### Hacker News Post Template

```
Show HN: Business-OS – AI-powered operating system for entrepreneurs (CLI)

I built Business-OS, an AI mentor that gives opinionated, stage-specific advice to founders. It runs entirely locally with SQLite + vector search for semantic memory.

Key features:
- AI mentor with founder personality (not generic ChatGPT)
- 15 pre-built workflows (customer validation, MVP planning, etc.)
- Automated daily briefs & weekly reviews
- Semantic search across all conversations
- 100% local, private (bring your own API key)

Why I built this: I've advised 50+ startups and kept repeating the same stage-specific advice. This CLI codifies that experience into an AI system.

Tech: TypeScript, Node.js, SQLite, OpenAI/Kimi/Anthropic, vector search (sqlite-vec)

Open source (MIT), installable via npm:
npm install -g business-os

Would love feedback from the HN community!

```

### Product Hunt Description

```
🚀 Business-OS - Your AI Co-Founder (CLI Edition)

Get opinionated, stage-specific startup advice from an AI mentor that actually remembers your business.

Unlike generic AI chatbots, Business-OS:
✅ Gives stage-aware advice (idea vs MVP vs growth)
✅ Remembers your entire business context
✅ Automates recurring founder tasks
✅ Runs 100% locally (complete privacy)

Perfect for:
- Solo founders who need a thinking partner
- Technical founders comfortable with CLI
- Privacy-conscious entrepreneurs
- Developers who prefer terminal workflows

Install in 30 seconds:
npm install -g business-os
