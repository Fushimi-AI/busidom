## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ship Weekly** | Every week ends with working software |
| **5 Users > 500 Features** | Validate with real people, not assumptions |
| **Cut Scope Ruthlessly** | Delete before adding |
| **Speed is a Feature** | Slow = death |
| **Build → Measure → Learn** | Don't guess, test |
