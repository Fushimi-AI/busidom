## Launch Announcement Template

### Product Hunt

**Title**: Busidom – Your AI co-founder with stage-specific startup advice

**Tagline**: Stop getting generic AI answers. Get opinionated guidance tailored to your business stage.

**Description**:
We built Busidom after advising 50+ startups and realizing founders ask the same stage-specific questions. Instead of generic ChatGPT responses, you get:

✨ Stage-aware AI mentor (idea → validation → MVP → growth → scale)
🔄 15 pre-built workflows (customer validation, MVP planning, etc.)
📊 Automated daily briefs & weekly reviews
🧠 Semantic memory (AI remembers your entire business)
📱 Web + Mobile apps with real-time sync

**First Comment**:
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built Busidom after spending 3 years advising startups.

The problem: Generic AI gives generic advice. But early-stage startups need VERY different guidance than growth-stage companies.

Busidom solves this with a stage-aware AI mentor that gives you the tough love and specific playbooks you need right now.

Would love your feedback! Happy to answer any questions. 🚀
