# Distribution Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**Build Distribution Before Product**

Instead of the traditional "build product first, then figure out distribution" approach, we're flipping the script:
1. Build audience and distribution channel FIRST
2. Launch product to an already engaged audience
3. Reduce launch risk and get faster initial traction

- ✅ Trust and credibility established
- ✅ Community of early adopters ready to test
- ✅ Feedback loop already active
- ✅ Marketing channel that continues to grow

- Video views and watch time
- Engagement rate (comments, likes, shares)
- Email list size
- Community activity
- Traffic to landing page

### Product Launch Metrics
- Conversion from audience to users

## Long-Term Vision

## Notes

This distribution-first strategy:

- Creates value immediately (helpful content)
- Builds sustainable growth channel
- Validates market demand before heavy product investment
- Creates competitive moat (audience + product)
