# Ideation Docs

**Warning:** Most of this is pre-validation planning. The prototype matters more than these docs.

## Essential (Read These)
- [core-concept/vision.md](./core-concept/vision.md) - The problem and solution
- [research-notes/elon.md](./research-notes/elon.md) - Mentor personality (used in prototype)
- [tech-stack/kimi-research.md](./tech-stack/kimi-research.md) - Why Kimi K2.5
- [tech-stack/coding-agents.md](./tech-stack/coding-agents.md) - Coding agent strategy (Kimi Code default)

## Reference (Read If Needed)
- [market/](./market/) - Positioning, pricing, distribution
- [tech-stack/](./tech-stack/) - Architecture, coding agents, Moltbot learnings

## Archived (v2 Stuff)
- [_archive/](._archive/) - Detailed features we cut from MVP

## The Rule

**Stop reading. Start building.**

Go to [/prototype](../prototype/) and run the code.
